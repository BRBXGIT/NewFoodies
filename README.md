# FoodiesNew

### App which i created just for practise and fun. This is an online shop with dishes

</div>

## New version of old app
- This is new version of my old app, which named foodies. I just wanted to see how fast and qualitatively i can remake old app. Of course i choose another design in practise purpose.
## Let's run through the features
- Minimalistick design
- Dishes sorted by category
- Custom top app bar with scroll behaviour
- Cart which was made with local db(api doesn't provides cart methods)
## Main point
- Main point was to create custom top app bar with scroll behaviour, because in old app i didn't do it in a right way
